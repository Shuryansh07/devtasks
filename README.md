# 🚀 DevTasks - Developer Task Manager

DevTasks is a simple and powerful task management web app built using **React**, designed specifically for developers to track coding tasks, bugs, and learning goals.

This project is part of my React learning journey, where I’m learning the fundamentals of React by building a real-world application — building in public, day by day.
